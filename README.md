# Starbucks
A few things happening here...
1) Ping the starbucks store locator to get every starbucks in the US
2) Use an already existing list of starbucks (Nov 2021) to get the congressional district they are all in
3) Find partisan lean of starbucks districts
--> does every CD have a starbucks?
--> avg density of starbucks
--> correlate density of starbucks to partisan lean
